# Business-Insights-360---Power-BI-Dashboard

“Business Insights 360” powered by Power BI is a comprehensive dashboard designed to provide AtliQ Hardware with actionable insights across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain.

Project Overview: AtliQ Hardware is a hardware manufacturing company that sells various hardware products to multiple customers across different countries and regions.

Problem: The company faced losses due to a poorly analyzed store opening in America. Competitors using advanced analytics pushed AtliQ to build their own analytics team for better decision-making.

Solution: I implemented Power BI to analyze over 1.5 million records, delivering actionable insights.

Project Execution:

Connecting MySQL database with Power BI
Data validation and transformation
Creating calculated columns
Data modeling
Building and designing the dashboards
Data validation and stakeholder feedback implementation
Techniques Used:

Data collection, transformation, and loading
Data modeling with Snowflake Schema

Using DAX functions (ALL, ALLEXCEPT, ALLNOBLANKROW, DIVIDE, SELECTEDVALUE, FILTER, MAX, SUM, SUMX, etc.)
Implementing KPI indicators with new Power BI card visuals

Building the Dashboard: Multiple stakeholders wanted to see different reports to analyze the performance of various departments. Therefore, I created multiple report views:

Finance View: Detailed financial analysis, including revenue, expenses, and profit margins.
Sales View: Insights into product and customer performance.
Marketing View: Analytics to enhance marketing strategy.
